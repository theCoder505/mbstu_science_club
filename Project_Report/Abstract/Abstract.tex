"CampusCertify Bangladesh" is a comprehensive SaaS-ready web application designed to digitize and streamline the operations of university co-curricular clubs. While initially deployed as a pilot for the Science Club of Mawlana Bhashani Science \& Technology University (MBSTU), the system is architected to support multi-tenancy, effectively serving as a centralized platform for club management across Bangladeshi universities.

The manual administration of student clubs involves redundant paperwork, transparent fund management challenges, and delayed certificate issuance. "CampusCertify" addresses these inefficiencies through a Hybrid Monolith architecture using Laravel 12 (Backend) and Vue.js 3 (Frontend). Key features include a public-facing dynamic portfolio, an automated certificate generation engine with drag-and-drop template design, and a secure Advisor workflow for digital approvals.

A rigorous testing phase, including Load Testing of 500 concurrent requests, demonstrated the system's stability. The resulting platform reduces certificate issuance time by 90\% and provides a verifiable digital record of student achievements, aligning with the vision of a Smart Bangladesh.
